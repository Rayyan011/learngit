full fathom fie thy father lies
of his bones are coral made
those were pearls that were his eyes
nothing of him that doth fade
but suffer a sea change
into something rich and strange
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds; to thy strong bidding
task Ariel and all his quality.
